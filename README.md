OpenIntents Repo Manifest
=========================

This manifest will check out all OpenIntents projects. You will
need to use repo (installation instructions can be found at the top of
http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html).

Getting all of the projects is achieved by running the following

    mkdir openintents
    cd openintents
    repo init -u https://github.com/openintents/openintents-repo-manifest.git
    repo sync
